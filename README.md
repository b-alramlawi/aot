## Description

A simple iOS app built with SwiftUI to fetch and display information about characters from *Attack on Titan*. The app uses Apple's modern UI framework, SwiftUI, and follows a clean architecture approach to deliver a minimal, elegant, and responsive user experience.

## Project Structure üìÅ

This SwiftUI project is built using **Clean Architecture**, ensuring modularity, maintainability, and testability. The structure is organized as follows:

- `Core/`: Contains networking logic (`APIClient`, endpoints, and constants) shared across the app.
- `Data/`: Includes Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and repository implementations that fetch and map API data.
- `Domain/`: Defines business logic, including `Entities`, `UseCases`, and `RepositoryProtocols` for abstraction.
- `Presentation/`: Organized by feature (`Characters`, `CharacterDetails`, `Splash`), each with:
  - `Views`: SwiftUI views for screens and subcomponents.
  - `ViewModels`: Logic and state for each view, using ObservableObject.
  - `Components`: Reusable UI components (e.g., rows, image views, search bars).
- `Resources/`: Contains app assets (icons, splash image) and localized strings.
- `AOTCharactersApp.swift`: The main entry point initializing the app.

This structure promotes a clear separation of concerns across UI, domain logic, and data layers, making it easier to develop and scale features independently.

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

This project uses modern iOS technologies to deliver a robust and user-friendly experience:

- **Swift**: A powerful and intuitive language for iOS development.
- **SwiftUI**: A declarative UI framework from Apple for building interfaces across all Apple platforms.
- **MVVM**: A design pattern that separates business logic from UI using ViewModels.
- **Clean Architecture**: Modular structure with Data, Domain, and Presentation layers.
- **Combine** *(optional)*: For reactive state management (can be extended).
- **URLSession**: Native networking to interact with the Attack on Titan API.
- **Async/Await**: For clean and efficient asynchronous programming.
- **SF Symbols and Material Design**: For consistent, modern UI components.

These technologies provide a scalable, efficient, and maintainable foundation for iOS app development.
